Deep Inside Object-oriented Python
======================

This repository contains code snippets used for my Object-Oriented Python presentations.

Last update 20150408.

The repository contains plain Python code (`code/` directory) and IPython Notebooks with the same content (`notebooks/` directory).

Inside the `code/` directory you will find the `python3/` and `python2/` subdirectories which contain code that works with that version of Python. Each file contains just snippets of code meant to be copied and pasted inside the Python console.

IPython notebooks are available for Python 3 only.
